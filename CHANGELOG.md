Changes in the current development version (install from GitHub):

### Changed

- **Speedup `t.test2()`** – Performance improvements.
- **`clear()`** – Now works with a one-time permission authorization: on first use you are prompted to type "yes" to allow clearing the global environment, console, and plot; that choice is saved for future sessions. If you do not type "yes", you are asked again next time.

## [0.1.8]

- Current release (see git history for earlier changes).
