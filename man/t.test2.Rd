\title{Enhanced alternative to t.test()}
\usage{
Identical to t.test()
}
\description{
The basic t-test function in R, \code{\link[stats]{t.test}}, does not report 
 the observed difference of means, does not stipulate which mean
 is subtracted from which (i.e., whether it computed A-B or B-A), and
 presents the test results on the console in a verbose unorganized 
 paragraph of text. \code{t.test2} improves on all those counts, and 
 in addition, it reports the number of observations per group and if any observations 
 are missing it issues a warning. It returns a dataframe instead of a list.

\examples{
# Two-sample t-test
men <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
women <- rnorm(100, mean = 4.8, sd = 1)
t.test2(men, women)

# Paired t-test
x <- rnorm(50, mean = 5, sd = 1)
y <- rnorm(50, mean = 5.2, sd = 1)
t.test2(x, y, paired = TRUE)

# One-sample t-test
data <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 1)
t.test2(data, mu = 0)

# Formula syntax
data <- data.frame(y = rnorm(100), group = rep(c("A", "B"), 50))
t.test2(y ~ group, data = data)
