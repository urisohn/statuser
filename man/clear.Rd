\usage{
clear(envir = parent.frame(), allow_global = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{envir}{The environment to clear. Defaults to the calling environment.
When clearing the global environment, the first interactive run may prompt
to save your preference; see Details.}

\item{allow_global}{If \code{TRUE}, clear the global environment without
prompting or using the saved preference. Default \code{FALSE} uses the
saved preference or prompts once.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Prints a colored confirmation message.
}
\description{
Clears plot, global environment, and console. On first use the user is
prompted to authorize clearing the environment to comply with CRAN rules.
}
\details{
This function performs three cleanup operations:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Plot}: Closes all open graphics devices (except the null device)
  \item \strong{Global environment}: Removes all objects from the specified environment
  \item \strong{Console}: Clears the console screen (only in interactive sessions)
}

When \code{envir} is the global environment, \code{clear()} will not modify it
unless (1) you pass \code{allow_global = TRUE}, or (2) you have previously
typed "yes" when prompted. If you do not type "yes", you are asked again next
time; only "yes" is remembered for future sessions.

\strong{Warning}: This function deletes all objects in the specified
environment. Save anything that you wish to keep before running.

\examples{
\donttest{
# Clear a temporary environment (safe for examples)
tmp_env <- new.env()
tmp_env$x <- 1:10
tmp_env$y <- rnorm(10)
clear(tmp_env)
}
# Interactive use: clear workspace, console, and plots
# First run may prompt; then clear(allow_global = TRUE) or your saved preference applies.

}
