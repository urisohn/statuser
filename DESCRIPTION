Title: R Function Designed for Stats Users, Not Statisticians, Nor Other R Functions 
Version: 0.1.5
Author: Uri Simonsohn [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Uri Simonsohn <urisohn@gmail.com>
Description: Improves basic R functios to produce output that is designed
with end-users in mind, rather than barebones clunky output written for experts
or for other functions to clean-up. For example, table2(), t.test2(), lm2() 
improve the corresponding procedures. Other functions generate publication ready 
plots in single lines of code  (plot_cdf(), plot_density(), plot_freq()). 
    workspace.
