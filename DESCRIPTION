Description: The statistical tools in this package do one of four things:
    1) Enhance basic statistical functions with more 
    flexible inputs, smarter defaults, and richer, clearer, and ready-to-use 
    output (e.g., t.test2())
    2) Produce publication-ready commonly needed figures with one line of code (e.g., plot_cdf())
    3) Implement novel analytical tools developed by the authors (e.g., twolines())
    4) Deliver niche functions of high value to the authors that are not easily
    available elsewhere (e.g., clear(), convert_to_sql(), resize_images()).
